= Anypoint™ Connectors Release Notes Template

The following is a proposed connector documentation template for documenting Release notes for MuleSoft connectors. The latest release should appear at the top of each connector's release notes page and the oldest section at the bottom.

= <System_Name> Connector Release Notes
////
[<System_Name>: The system the connector connects to, at the other end of the mule runtime, i.e. SalesForce, Workday Financials]
////
:keywords: add_keywords_separated_by_commas

_If applicable, label the connector either: Premium / Select / Standard / or Community_

One to three sentences describing the connector's functionality and basic information that applies to all connector versions. For a new version of an existing connector, you do not need to modify this blurb.

*Guide:* <Connector_Guide_Link>
////
Points to the docs.mulesoft pages for documentation on the functional aspects of the connector. e.g.: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/microsoft-sharepoint-2013-connector[Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Connector]
////

== <Connector_Version> - <Release_date>
////
<Connector_Version> : Describes the connector version, such as “V2013”, “V4.0”, “V4.0.1-HF2” or whatever used for release]
<Release_date> : The date on which the connector is released (not when the notes are written, mind you)

=== Compatibility

|Application/Service|Version

|Mule Runtime|<Supported_Mule_Version> Indicates which versions of the Mule runtime are supported, i.e.: 3.5.1 and higher, 3.4.3 and Higher, 3.6.0, etc
|<System_Name>|<System_Version>

=== Migrating from Older Versions

If you’re currently using connector <old_connector_version> to migrate to this connector you need to:

- <step_1>
- <step_2>

If you’re currently using a connector version <old_connector_version_2> this connector is not compatible. Don’t upgrade to this connector unless you are sure you do the following:

- <step_3>
- <step_4>

<Step_1 to N should be clear instructions that pertain to the migration path from one connector to the other.

//Examples might include

//- Specifying which version of the runtime is needed for the new connector
//- Changes in the version of the connected systems to be able to work
//- When the connector suffers structural changes (i.e monolythic connectors now many update sites) we should also inform the split and why and how to update from one to //the other.
//- Specific instructions if the connector is running in CloudHub (like changing the Mule Runtime version, etc)
//- The first list of steps is for in-place upgrades, probably just updating via Maven or  Anypoint Studio  and re deploying.
//- The second list is for the connectors that are older and require additional steps.
//- Some of this might not apply (i.e. a connector is backwards compatible with all released versions or there is no previous version)


=== Features

. <Feature_Title> - A description of the feature

//Example of a Feature listing:

//NTLM Authentication - NTLM authentication is now more robust and widely compatible with more domain controller configurations.

=== Fixed in this Release

- <Bug_Title> - <Conditions under which the bug used to happen, explain which was the result, which is now the fixed result>

//Example of a Bug listing:

//- Asyncronous processing now works when invoking via an External interface - Previously, when invoking an asyncronous service, the call could end up in a deadlock unless //lock(object) was used. Now, the connector locks automatically and you don’t need to do it.

//Example of what is NOT A BUG listing

//- Fixed CLDCONNECT-XYZ (because projects are not public)
//- Functional tests XYZ now work (because functional testing or any other part of the development process is not visible to customers)
//- Increased Sonar coverage (ditto)
//- Resolved NPE (lacking information like scenarios under which it can be reproduced, what is NPE, etc)

=== Known Issues

<Connector_Issues, use the same format as Bug listings>
