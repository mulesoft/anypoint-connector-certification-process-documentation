The following is the approved connector user guide template for documenting MuleSoft supported connectors.
////

= Connector Name
:keywords: add_keywords_separated_by_commas
:imagesdir: ./_images

////
Image names follow "image:". Identify images using the connector name, preferably without the word "connector"
URLs should always follow "link:"
////

// Dropdown for Connector Version
//  Children: Technical Reference / Demos

The first sentence introduces the connector and describes its basic function. Do not insert a table of contents macro or a heading before the first paragraph.

//Global rule: the word "connector" should be lower case except when appearing in titles, important URL anchors, and after a MuleSoft tradename such as "Anypoint".

Read this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations, and API version updates with each release of the connector using the link:/release-notes/xyz-connector-release-notes[Connector Release Notes]. Review the connector operations and functionality using the link:/link-to-github.io-or-internal-section[Technical Reference] along side the https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?type=connector[Anypoint Exchange demo application].

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[_Insert Category_] connector support policy.

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, and Anypoint Studio. 

For hardware and software requirements, see the link:/release-notes/connector[Connector Release Notes].

[[install]]
== How to Install

You can install the connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in
link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-studio[To Add Exchange Assets to Studio].

[[upgrading]]
=== To Upgrade from an Older Version

If you’re currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with the Updates Available message.

. Click the popup and check for available updates. 
. Click the connector version checkbox, click Next, and follow the instructions provided by the user interface. 
. Restart Studio when prompted. 
. When creating a flow and using the connector if there are several versions of the connector installed, you can choose the version to use.

Keep Studio up to date with its latest version.

[[ns-schema]]
== About the Connector Namespace and Schema

In Anypoint Studio, when you drag the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

*Namespace:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector+` +
*Schema Location:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-connector.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or another text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:connector="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-connector.xsd">

      <!-- put your global configuration elements and flows here -->

</mule>
----

*Note:* Use `current` in the schema path. Studio interprets this to the current Mule version.

[[maven]]
== Maven Dependency Information

For Maven dependency management, include this XML snippet in your `pom.xml` file.

[[configure]]
== To Configure the Connector

Place the connector in your flow as applicable for your use case.

To use the `<connector>` connector in your Mule application, create a global <connector> element for use by the <connector> connector. The <connector> connector provides the following global configuration(s), requiring the following credentials: *Username*, *Password*...

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Username |Enter the username to log in with.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password.

[[operations]]
== Operations

Outbound, inbound, streaming outbound  +

[NOTE]
See a full list of operations for any version of the connector link:[here].


== About Common Use Cases

Explain the common and less intuitive use cases and provide links to them in the bullets.
//These may include an example app that can be deployed in Mule or links to Exchange

* link:#use-case-1[Configure Connector to ...]
* link:#use-case-2[Configure Authentication via ...]


[use-case-1]
=== To Configure Connector to ...

// Limit to 9 steps
// Do NOT provide a parallel XML walkthrough. Weave any XML details into steps. Also avoid any unnecessary or marginally helpful screenshots.

Explain the use case and provide a complete working example if possible.

The section should contain a fully functional Mule application as a demo, where the use case is considered. Explain how to create this case with the Anypoint Studio Visual editor and list the app.

Download the deployable app archive and import into Anypoint Studio to interact with the example application.

[use-case-2]
=== To Configure Authentication Using ...


== To Improve Connector Performance

To define the pooling profile for the connector manually, access the *Pooling Profile* tab in the applicable global element for the connector.

For background information on pooling, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tuning-performance[Tuning Performance].
